# Edge-Computing

What  is Edge Computing ?
Simply we can say method of optimising cloud computing systems by performing data processing at the edge of the network, near the source of the data.
Depending on the implementation, time-sensitive data in an edge computing architecture may be processed at the point of origin by an intelligent device or  sent to an intermediary server located in close geographical proximity to the client.  Data that is less time sensitive is sent to the cloud for historical analysis, big data analytics and long-term storage.
